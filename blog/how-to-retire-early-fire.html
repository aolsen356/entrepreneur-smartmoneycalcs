                <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">What is the FIRE Movement?</h2>

                <p>FIRE stands for <strong>Financial Independence, Retire Early</strong>. It's a lifestyle movement focused on three core principles:</p>

                <div class="grid md:grid-cols-3 gap-6 my-8">
                    <div class="bg-gray-50 rounded-lg p-6">

                        <h3 class="font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">Extreme Saving</h3>
                        <p class="text-sm text-gray-600">FIRE followers save 50-70%+ of their income, far exceeding the typical 10-15% savings rate. Every dollar saved is a step toward freedom.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="bg-gray-50 rounded-lg p-6">
                        <div class="text-3xl mb-3">&#128200;</div>
                        <h3 class="font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">Smart Investing</h3>
                        <p class="text-sm text-gray-600">Savings are invested in low-cost index funds to grow passively. The goal: build a portfolio that generates enough income to cover all expenses forever.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="bg-gray-50 rounded-lg p-6">
                        <div class="text-3xl mb-3">&#127774;</div>
                        <h3 class="font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">Intentional Living</h3>
                        <p class="text-sm text-gray-600">FIRE isn't about deprivation&mdash;it's about spending on what truly matters and cutting what doesn't. Happiness comes from experiences, not stuff.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <p><strong>The result?</strong> Instead of working until 65, FIRE followers often retire in their 30s, 40s, or early 50s. "Retire" doesn't mean sitting on a beach&mdash;it means having the <em>option</em> to work, travel, volunteer, or pursue passion projects without needing a paycheck.</p>

                    <h3 class="font-semibold text-blue-800 mb-2">The Origins of FIRE</h3>
                    <p class="text-blue-700 text-sm">The FIRE movement traces back to the 1992 book <em>Your Money or Your Life</em> by Vicki Robin and Joe Dominguez. It gained mainstream attention through blogs like Mr. Money Mustache, Mad Fientist, and ChooseFI. Today, millions of people worldwide are pursuing financial independence.</p>

                <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">How to Calculate Your FIRE Number</h2>

                <p>Your <strong>FIRE number</strong> is the amount of money you need invested to retire. The calculation is simple:</p>

                <div class="bg-gradient-to-r from-primary to-emerald-600 text-white rounded-xl p-8 my-8 text-center">
                    <p class="text-lg text-emerald-100 mb-2">The FIRE Formula</p>
                    <p class="text-4xl font-bold mb-2">Annual Expenses x 25 = FIRE Number</p>
                    <p class="text-emerald-200 text-sm">Based on the 4% safe withdrawal rate</p>
                </div>

                <p>This formula comes from the <strong>4% Rule</strong> (also called the Trinity Study). Research shows that if you withdraw 4% of your portfolio in Year 1 and adjust for inflation each year, you have a 95%+ chance of your money lasting 30+ years.</p>

                        <h3 class="font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-2">How much money do I need to retire early?</h3>
                        <p class="text-gray-600">Your annual expenses x 25. If you spend $40,000/year, you need $1,000,000. This is based on the 4% safe withdrawal rate. For very early retirement, use 30-33x for extra safety.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="border-b pb-4">
                        <h3 class="font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-2">What is the FIRE movement?</h3>
                        <p class="text-gray-600">FIRE (Financial Independence, Retire Early) is a lifestyle movement focused on extreme saving (50-70%), frugal living, and smart investing to retire decades early&mdash;typically in your 30s, 40s, or early 50s.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="border-b pb-4">
                        <h3 class="font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-2">Can I retire early on an average salary?</h3>
                        <p class="text-gray-600">Yes. The key is savings rate, not income. Someone earning $60K who saves 50% can reach $750K in 15 years. Many FIRE achievers started with average salaries&mdash;expense control matters more than income.</p>
                    </div>

                        <h3 class="font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-2">What is the 4% rule?</h3>
                        <p class="text-gray-600">The 4% rule says you can safely withdraw 4% of your portfolio in year one, then adjust for inflation each year. Based on historical data, this has a 95%+ success rate over 30 years.</p>
                    </div>

                        <h3 class="font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-2">What are the types of FIRE?</h3>
                        <p class="text-gray-600">Fat FIRE ($100K+/year, $2.5M+), Lean FIRE ($20-40K/year, $500K-1M), Barista FIRE (part-time work + smaller portfolio), and Coast FIRE (stop saving, let investments grow to traditional retirement).</p>

                        <h3 class="font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-2">How do I invest for early retirement?</h3>
                        <p class="text-gray-600">Low-cost index funds (VTI, VXUS) in tax-advantaged accounts (401k, IRA) plus taxable brokerage for early access. Simple, boring, effective. 90% stocks, 10% bonds for aggressive growth.</p>

                        <h3 class="font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-2">How do I access retirement money before 59.5?</h3>
                        <p class="text-gray-600">Taxable brokerage (no restrictions), Roth IRA contributions (always accessible), Roth conversion ladder (5-year wait), SEPP/72(t) distributions, or Rule of 55 for 401k. Most use taxable + Roth ladder combination.</p>
