                <div class="space-y-6">
                    <div class="border-b pb-4">
                        <h3 class="font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-2">How long does it take to build credit from nothing?</h3>
                        <p class="text-gray-600">You can establish a credit score in as little as 6 months with consistent activity. To reach a "good" score (670+), expect 6-12 months of responsible credit use. A "very good" score (740+) typically takes 12-24 months for new credit builders.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="border-b pb-4">
                        <h3 class="font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-2">What's the fastest way to build credit in 2026?</h3>
                        <p class="text-gray-600">The fastest method is becoming an authorized user on someone else's established credit card account. This can add years of credit history to your file in 30-60 days. Combine this with a secured credit card and credit builder loan for maximum speed.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="border-b pb-4">
                        <h3 class="font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-2">Can I build credit without a credit card?</h3>
                        <p class="text-gray-600">Yes! Credit builder loans, rent reporting services (like Rental Kharma), and Experian Boost (which reports utility and streaming payments) can all build credit without a traditional credit card.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="border-b pb-4">
                        <h3 class="font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-2">What credit score do you start with?</h3>
                        <p class="text-gray-600">You don't start with any credit score. You have no score until you have at least one credit account that's been reported to the bureaus for at least 6 months. After that, most people start between 500-650 depending on their initial credit behavior.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="border-b pb-4">
                        <h3 class="font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-2">Does checking my credit score hurt it?</h3>
                        <p class="text-gray-600">No. Checking your own credit score is a "soft inquiry" and has zero impact on your score. Only "hard inquiries" from lenders when you apply for credit affect your score, and even then, the impact is small (5-10 points) and temporary.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="border-b pb-4">
                        <h3 class="font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-2">Should I get a secured or unsecured credit card first?</h3>
                        <p class="text-gray-600">Start with a secured credit card if you have no credit history. Secured cards require a deposit (typically $200-500) that becomes your credit limit. After 6-12 months of responsible use, you can graduate to an unsecured card and get your deposit back.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="pb-4">
                        <h3 class="font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-2">What credit utilization should I aim for?</h3>
                        <p class="text-gray-600">Keep your credit utilization under 10% for the best score impact (not 30% as commonly believed). For example, if you have a $500 credit limit, keep your balance under $50. Pay off your balance before the statement date to report the lowest possible utilization.</p>
