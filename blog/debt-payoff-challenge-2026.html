                <p>Every year, millions of Americans make the same New Year's resolution: "This is the year I'll get out of debt." And every year, 78% of them fail by February.</p>

                <p>Not because they lack willpower. Not because they don't want it badly enough. But because they don't have a <strong>system</strong>.</p>

                <p>That changes today. The 2026 Debt Payoff Challenge gives you exactly what other "debt-free" programs lack:</p>

                <ul class="space-y-2">
                    <li><strong>Specific monthly milestones</strong> &mdash; Know exactly what to do each month</li>
                    <li><strong>Accountability checkpoints</strong> &mdash; Built-in progress reviews to keep you on track</li>
                    <li><strong>Obstacle solutions</strong> &mdash; Pre-planned responses to common setbacks</li>
                    <li><strong>Free calculator tools</strong> &mdash; See your exact payoff date and interest savings</li>
                </ul>

                </div>

                <p>Whatever your debt number is, this challenge will help you make serious progress. Some participants will be completely debt-free by December 2026. Others will have paid off 30-50% of their balances. Either outcome puts you miles ahead of where you'd be without a plan.</p>

                        <h3 class="font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-2">What if I miss a month in the debt payoff challenge?</h3>
                        <p class="text-gray-600">Missing a month doesn't mean you've failed. Simply pick up where you left off the next month. The key is to not let one slip-up derail your entire year. Many successful challenge completers missed 1-2 months and still achieved their goals by catching up in later months.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="border-b pb-4">
                        <h3 class="font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-2">Should I use debt avalanche or snowball for this challenge?</h3>
                        <p class="text-gray-600">Either method works for this challenge. Choose <strong>avalanche</strong> (highest interest first) if you want to save the most money. Choose <strong>snowball</strong> (smallest balance first) if you need quick wins to stay motivated. Use our <a href="../calculators/debt-payoff.html" class="text-primary hover:underline">Debt Payoff Calculator</a> to see exactly how much each method saves you.</p>
                    </div>

                        <h3 class="font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-2">Can I do the debt payoff challenge with student loans?</h3>
                        <p class="text-gray-600">Absolutely! Student loans are perfect for this challenge. The 12-month structure helps you make consistent progress on large balances. Focus on paying more than the minimum each month, and consider refinancing if you can get a lower rate.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="border-b pb-4">
                        <h3 class="font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-2">How much should I pay extra each month?</h3>
                        <p class="text-gray-600">Start with whatever extra you can afford, even if it's just $50-100. The challenge helps you find more money as you go. Most successful participants increase their extra payments by 10-20% every quarter as they cut expenses and find side income.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="border-b pb-4">
                        <h3 class="font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-2">Should I build an emergency fund before paying off debt?</h3>
                        <p class="text-gray-600">Yes, but start small. We recommend having at least $1,000-2,000 in emergency savings before aggressively attacking debt. This prevents you from going back into debt when unexpected expenses arise. Use our <a href="../calculators/emergency-fund.html" class="text-primary hover:underline">Emergency Fund Calculator</a> to find your target. Once your debt is paid off, build your full 3-6 month emergency fund.</p>

                        <h3 class="font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-2">What if I get laid off during the challenge?</h3>
                        <p class="text-gray-600">If you lose your job, immediately switch to minimum payments only and focus on finding new income. Your emergency fund (built in Month 1) should cover essentials. Once employed again, resume extra payments. This is a temporary pause, not the end of your challenge.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="border-b pb-4">
                        <h3 class="font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-2">Can I start the debt payoff challenge mid-year?</h3>
                        <p class="text-gray-600">Yes! While January is the most popular start date, you can begin this 12-month challenge any time. Many people start in September (back-to-school motivation), their birthday month, or simply whenever they're ready to commit.</p>

                        <h3 class="font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-2">Should I consolidate my debt during this challenge?</h3>
                        <p class="text-gray-600">Debt consolidation can help if you qualify for a lower interest rate than your current debts. It simplifies payments to one monthly bill. However, don't consolidate just to feel like you're making progress &mdash; the math needs to work in your favor. Read our <a href="debt-consolidation-vs-settlement.html" class="text-primary hover:underline">consolidation vs. settlement guide</a> to compare options.</p>
